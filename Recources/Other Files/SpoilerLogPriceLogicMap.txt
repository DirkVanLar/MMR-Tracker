//This file keeps track of what spoiler log Price values should be assigned to what entries in logic
//Below is an example of this system making full use of all its features 

//UpgradeBigBombBag,BombBagUpgrade | Big Bomb Bag Purchase, Big Bomb Bag Purchase (Town), Big Bomb Bag Purchase (Mountain) !AltBombBagPurchase & CanBuyinMountains !CanBuyBombBags

//How it works:
//First it will look for an item in your logic called "UpgradeBigBombBag" and if it can't find that, it will then look for "BombBagUpgrade".
//You can add any number of Logic names in this way using a comma seperated list. It will Prioritize them from left to right.
//If it finds either of the above it will the look for "Big Bomb Bag Purchase", "Big Bomb Bag Purchase (Town)" and "Big Bomb Bag Purchase (Mountain)" in your spoiler log.
//If it finds any of those it will assign the Logic check the lowest price out the objects in that list that it found in the spoiler log.
//You can add any number of values in this way using a comma seperated list.
//The ! defines conditions in which this line will be ignored. If the Logic name following the ! is found in your logic, the current line will be ignored.
//You can define multiple Logic names in one statement using an &. In this case each of those logic names must exist in your logic for the line to be ignored.
//Having more than one ! is like using an OR statement. If any of the ! procede an entry that exists in your logic the line will be ignored.
//In the example above, the logic can be read as "IF (AltBombBagPurchase AND CanBuyinMountains) OR (CanBuyBombBags) Exists in logic, the Line will be ignored"

//Using "#GAMECODESTART: 'Your Games Game Code'" will make the following lines only be processed if the corresponding game code is loaded
//Multiple gamecodes can be defined in a comma seperated lits ex: (#GAMECODESTART:MMR,OOTR)
//Using "#GAMECODEEND:" will exit the game code restriction
