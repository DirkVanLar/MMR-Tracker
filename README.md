# MMR-Tracker
An Item, Location and Entrance Tracker for the Majoras Mask Randomizer

Basic Functionality:
You will supply this tracker the logic file used to generate your seed and it will show you every location that is available to check based on the logic and items you have obtained.
Double clicking a location will ask you to select what item was found there, or you can import you html spoiler log to have this done automatically.
If you know what item a location contains, you can set the location to display what item is located there without actually checking it.
All checked locations will be displayed in a separate box displaying the location and item that was found there.

Item Settings:
You can customize what locations are Randomized, unrandomized or junk. Unrandomized items will be automatically obtained when they are available and junk locations will be hidden from the tracker.
You can set items as starting items to have the tracker always consider them obtained.

Entrance Randomizer Features:
When entrance randomizer releases, the tracker will have a sperate box to keep track of available entrances.
When checking an entrance, the tracker will automatically mark the entrance in reverse.
You can use the pathfinder to show you available paths from one entrance to another.

Extra Features:
You can use the Seed Checker to check if your seed can obtain a number of selected items based on your logic.
You can tell the seed checker to ignore certain checks you want to avoid.

You can use the playthrough generator to create a guide that will tell you what items you need to obtain, where they are, and in what order you need to obtain them to beat the game.
