Categories
The Categories.txt file will determine how the tracker sorts location areas. 
Order the location areas in the file the same way you would like them ordered in the tracker. 
Including unused location areas is fine.

Custom Logic Presets
Add a .txt logic file to the "Custom Logic Presets" folder to add that logic file as a custom logic preset under "File -> Presets". 
Logic files hosted on the web can be added using the "Web Presets" file in the same folder. (see file for instructions)
