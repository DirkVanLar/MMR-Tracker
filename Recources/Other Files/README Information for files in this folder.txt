Categories
The Categories.txt file will determine how the tracker sorts location areas. 
Order the location areas in the file the same way you would like them ordered in the tracker. 
More information can be found in the file.

WalletValues
The WalletValues.txt file is used for Price randomization. When a check is assigned a randomized Price
it will sue the values in this file to know what wallet item it should append to the checks logic
to make it obtainable.

SpoilerLogPriceMap
The Categories.txt file allows you to customize what checks to assign price data from the spoiler log to.
By default this file is setup to handle it exactly like the randomizer does, so there will probably never be a need to edit it.
However, if you would like to change how the tracker handles this, this file does support some very robust configuration.

Other Game Premade Logic
This folder contains premade logic files for various other games that the tracker supports

Custom Logic Presets
Add a .txt logic file to the "Custom Logic Presets" folder to add that logic file as a custom logic preset under "File -> Presets". 
Logic files hosted on the web can be added using the "Web Presets" file in the same folder. (see file for instructions)
